  \x1B[1m Overview: \x1B[22m

    Generate files and folders from a template file.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \x1B[1m Details: \x1B[22m

    Template files provide the heirarchy of structure which explains the
    nesting of files and folders. Template files are plain textual files.

    Indentation:
      Determines what file or folder types should be on the same folder level.
      Same indentation level between two lines means that the lines
      are siblings assuming that the two have the same parent.

      White space characters such as tabs or spaces define the indentations.
      However, only one type of white space character can be used at
      any one time in a single template file.

    Lines:
      All non-blank lines will be counted towards the generation if the line
      is valid for generation.

    Structure Type:
      File:
        A content line without a folder marker (forward slash) will be
        identified as a file line.

        Ex:
          a-file
          a-file-with-an-extension.someextension

      Folder:
        A content line with a folder marker (forward slash) will be identified
        as a folder type. A folder line can also be signified with having
        a later line with a greater indent than the folder line.

        Ex:
          /a-folder

          or

          a-folder
            child-with-greater-indentation

    demo                 N/A
                          Shows an example of how a template file is used
                          to generate files and folder inside the /demo folder
                          of the Dirgen NPM module.

    -f                  Overwrite files and directory even if they already
                        exist. Default behavior without this option does not
                        forcibly overwrite content.
