  \x1B[1m Overview: \x1B[22m

    Generate files and folders from a template file.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \x1B[1m Details: \x1B[22m

   \x1B[1m Template file: \x1B[22m

    Template files provide the heirarchy of structure which explains the
    nesting of files and folders. Template files are plain textual files.

    Indentation:
      Determines what file or folder types should be on the same folder level.
      Same indentation level between two lines means that the lines
      are siblings assuming that the two have the same parent.

      White space characters such as tabs or spaces define the indentations.
      However, only one type of white space character can be used at
      any one time in a single template file.

    Lines:
      All non-blank lines will be counted towards the generation if the line
      is valid for generation.

    Structure Type:
      File:
        A content line without a folder marker (forward slash) will be
        identified as a file line.

        Example:
          a-file
          a-file-with-an-extension.someextension

      Folder:
        A content line with a folder marker (forward slash) will be identified
        as a folder type. A folder line can also be signified with having
        a later line with a greater indent than the folder line.

        Example:
          /a-folder

          or

          a-folder
            child-with-greater-indentation

  \x1B[1m Example Generation Output: \x1B[22m

    Template:
      gsdf
      	afsd
      //sd,ss
      dfg
      	jj
      	ygvhg
      		dsd
      	ygvhg
      /fsfa
      /fsfa

    Console output:

     Warning: Line #3: '//sd,ss', has illegal characters which has been
      replaced, resulting in 'sd,ss'.

     Warning: Line #8: 'ygvhg', of file type is a repeated line and was
     not generated. First appearance of sibling is on line #6.

     Warning: Line #10: '/fsfa', of folder type is a repeated line and
     was not generated . First appearance of sibling is on line #9.

     Template info: 10 total lines (10 content, 0 blanks)
     Template read: 0 errors and 3 warnings
     Creation count: 8 generated, 2 not generated, 0 skipped
     Generation failures: 0 write errors
     Write time: 35262057 nanoseconds

    Explanation:

      Template info:

        Content:
          Lines that have characters which are non-white space. These line
          may or may not be generated.

        Blanks:
          Lines that are white-space only characters or has not characters
          at all. These lines are never generated.

      Template read:

        Errors:
          Upon one or more error, there will be no
          generated file or folders.

        Warnings:
          Warning lines that are correctable such as having non-permissible
          characters can be sanitized and generated, but incorrect lines
          such as duplicated line content will be not be generated.

      Creation count:

        Generated:
          Lines that were read that were successfully created

        Not generated:
          Lines that produced a warning that may or may
          not have been generated.

        Skipped:
          Lines that were skipped because they already exists. By default
          existing files and folders are not overwritten to prevent data lost.

        Generated, Not generated, and Skipped counts total up to the
        total line count of the template file.

      Generation failures:
        Failures occurs when a valid line creation attempt did not go through.
        The generation failures counts towards the "Skipped" of
        "Creation count".

      Write time:
        The time taken to write all the files and folders. Will yield "0" when
        at least one error has occurred on reading the template file because
        nothing will be generated.

  \x1B[1m Options: \x1B[22m

    -f                  Overwrite files and directory even if they already
                        exist. Default behavior without this option does not
                        forcibly overwrite content.

    -s                  Suppress the actual warnings and errors messages from
                        showing up on the console. The count of warnings and
                        errors will still be shown in the generation output
                        information.
