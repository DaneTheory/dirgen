async behavior of the generate, use async await

log the top level entries that are not repeats in the linesInfo
and use to keep a ref for consistent generation
of children when down with current line

top line repeated validator logic redo
  should only write the latest line on repeats


ensure the ordering of repeats in the nested childs


failure to generate when the last line in the template is not on the same level as the first content line

  -parent folder with the same name child items and repeated child names does trigger error message?


mixed and tabs and spaces on the space line passes through validation checks

does not gen twnsbxh

presence of content already in folder does not cause an overwrite?

version timing problem on the tests
test deeply nested folder structures

Backlog/Optimize
-- pluralizing the error messages
-try catch in the async await is required
-right and left trim
npm start more compatible with windows
-combinations of warnings
--programatic use should have object pass in
--remove existsAsync when used programmatically

--encoding type
--permission level
--step through
  --overwrite
  -warn [skip|ignore|walk]

Module
-module type support
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
  -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
  npmignore and gitignore
