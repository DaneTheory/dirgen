Validations

-list groups of repeated line number
  -aggregate all the warnings on the first level
    -and then for the nested later level lines
  -combinations of warnings
  -also list out all warnings before the critical errors
-repeated lines check in the top-most level
-when errors occur the program should exit immediately, however the timer should still be kept?

Generation
-Use trampa to protect against deeply nested folder because of recursion

Commandline
-take input arguments
(info in the js file)

testing

Optimize
Remove the lodash dependency or rollup?
npm start more compatible with windows
reduce the cyclomatic complexity
-detect if the file has changed in the middle of operations
-- pluralizing the error messages

Module
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
  -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
  npmignore and gitignore
