generate
-case by case scenarios

  -differing indent factor
    -outdent situation fix

  -length of file or folder
    -does not error out when the long file type is on the first line

  -lack of content in the template file


safer checks for when the content line is the only line in the whole file


check for continued generation of files and folders after a warning has occurred
-/a/fadsafd on the first line caused things to not continue generating


Backlog/Optimize
-try catch in the async await is required
-right and left trim
selective includes lodash dependency?
npm start more compatible with windows
-- pluralizing the error messages
-combinations of warnings

--encoding type
--permission level
--step through
  --overwrite
  -warn [skip|ignore|walk]

Module
-module type support
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
  -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
  npmignore and gitignore
