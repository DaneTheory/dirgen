Optimize
Remove the lodash dependency or rollup?
npm start more compatible with windows
reduce the cyclomatic complexity
-detect if the file has changed in the middle of operations
-- pluralizing the error messages
-combinations of warnings
-also list out all warnings before the critical errors

Module
-What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
-Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
  -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
  npmignore and gitignore
