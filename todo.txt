issues

  error logs in generation touch ups

Module
  -What should be checked in to the final npm repo?
  -Selective check-ins for the dist folder:
    -not dist folder on git, but allow for npm?
    npmignore and gitignore

  nodejs4 support and above upon compilation

  npm start more compatible with windows/linux

why dirgen
  repetitive boilerplate projects
  for unit testing when generating folders
